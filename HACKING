If you are just interested in knowing how to post a bug you've found, just
read the section "Reporting Bugs" in README and follow the instructions.

This file is intended to help new developers to get started with developing
for Boxes. Feel free to skip sections if you know what they are about.

Another good source for general information is:

1. How to Provide a Good Patch
==============================

* Read the CodingStyle.txt.
* Make sure you have just what belongs there in the changeset.
* Read https://wiki.gnome.org/Git/CommitMessages carefully.
* The preferred way of appending patches to bugs is via git bz.
  * As an alternative you can use "git format-patch HEAD~1".
* The bugtracker has some quite cool features; use them!
* Click on review to write comments to other or your patches or to comment
  comments on these patches
* Dont be afraid about criticism! The review process is probably going to be long.
* We dont dislike you! We really appreciate your work.
